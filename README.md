# TaskTimers
An Android app that keeps track of when you last did some task.
## The Idea
The app will contain a list of "task" boxes that contain different types of tasks. All tasks will include a title / name and an indication of when they were last done.

Task types:
- Simple Task - Just a name and when it was last done.
- Interval Task - A task with a completion frequency (e.g. "every 12H" or "every 3 days"). Will show time until task is due, or how over due.
- Calendar Task - A task that can be set to repeat like a calendar event (e.g. "every 3<sup>rd</sup> Monday" or "the 5<sup>th</sup> of each month").

## Interaction / UI
The app will have a list of tasks and some sort of "+" / "plus" button to add tasks. A tap on a task will mark it as done, and a long press will allow you to edit / delete a task.
